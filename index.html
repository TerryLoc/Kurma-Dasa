          <h3>A background glimpse</h3>
          <p>
            Born in England in 1952, Kurma Dasa moved to Australia with his
            parents in 1964. In the early 1970s, he became a member of the Hare
            Krishna movement and travelled to India many times, learning
            regional cuisines by assisting cooks in temples, restaurants, and
            private homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1980, Kurma Dasa was head chef at Gopal’s Vegetarian Restaurant
            in Swanston Street, Melbourne, specializing in Vedic (traditional
            Indian) cooking. Producing 1,800 meals a week made Gopal’s one of
            Australia’s best-known vegetarian eating places.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the mid-1980s, Kurma Dasa has been teaching widely. His 1987
            television series, Cooking with Kurma, enjoyed great popularity,
            spawning the much-reissued Great Vegetarian Dishes. Kurma Dasa has
            since hosted two television series screened in 46 countries. He
            currently lives in Porto, Portugal with his wonderful wife Dhira
            Laita.
